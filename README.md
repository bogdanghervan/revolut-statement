## Usage

**Convert a single statement to CSV**

To convert a Revolut stock trade PDF statement to CSV:
```
revolut-statement convert statement-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pdf > my-statement.csv
```

In the example above `statement-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pdf` is a likely name of the PDF statement downloaded from the Revolut app. The command would read the file and convert it to a CSV file named `my-statement.csv`.

**Convert multiple statements to CSV**

You can convert more PDF statements at the same time by specifying a list of files separated by space in the command line:
```
revolut-statement convert statement-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pdf statement-vvvvvvvv-wwww-xxxx-yyyy-zzzzzzzzzzzz.pdf > all-statements.csv
```

In the example above, the two PDF statements would be stitched together in one single CSV file called `all-statements.csv`. Now you can use this file to run analyses on your successful trades or prepare your tax reports.

**Convert a statement to Excel**

To convert a Revolut stock trade PDF statement to Excel:
```
revolut-statement convert statement-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pdf -f xlsx -o my-statement.xlsx
```

**Convert multiple files matching a pattern**

A common use case is wanting to stitch together several PDF stock trade statements downloaded from Revolut in the same directory that have a file name resembling `statement-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pdf`. Here's how to do that simply:
```
revolut-statement convert statement-*.pdf -f xlsx -o all-statements.xlsx -v
```

Pro tip: Pass in the `-v` option to see additional details while files are parsed.
